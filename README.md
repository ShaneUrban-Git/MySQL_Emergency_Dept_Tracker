# MySQL_Emergency_Dept_Tracker

The purpose of this database is to provider a free resource for anyone interested in learning MySQL. Also, please provide feedback as I am a novice writing SQL code, so this database is meant to teach myself new skills as it is for others to have a free resource to learn SQL coding. 

The below code can be ran in the MySQL Workbench environment to create a rudimentary database for tracking patients seen in an emergency department (ED). This topic was decided upon as if offer 20 years of emergency medicine experience working as an EMT, paramedic, registered nurse, and professional resercher.

The patients examples are as 'real' as possible; however, I tried to balance real-world emergency medical thinking with the design of a practical, and not overly engineered database.

In order to make interacting with the database a more enriching experience, I will annotate my code with clinical insights, explainations, and definitions. 

Kind regards,
